# Pomo-Timer
A very simple minimalistic Pomodoro timer in C using only Raylib.

## Features
- Short break.
- Long break (after configurable short breaks).
- Work period.
- Sound bell notification when work, short break or long break period begins.
- Pause mode. Timer is held in current mode.

## Keys:
- Enter: Begin work.
- s: Jump to a short break.
- l: Jump to a long break.
- w: Jump to a work period.
- Space: Pause timer.

### Note:

simple to port to other platforms.
